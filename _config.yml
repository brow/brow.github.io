# "If all gem plugins have the same priority, they will be executed in the
# order they are required, generally. Thus, if you have other plugins which
# generate content and store that content in site.pages, site.posts, or
# site.collections, be sure to require jekyll-sitemap either after those other
# gems if you want the sitemap to include the generated content, or before
# those other gems if you don't want the sitemap to include the generated
# content from the gems. "
