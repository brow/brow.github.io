Set timers on your iPhone without touching or unlocking it. Just ask Siri.

<img class="small" src="images/demo.gif" />

Timelord is designed for sticky-fingered cooks without a free hand:

* Set timers and check their progress by asking Siri
* Run any number of timers at once
* No need to unlock your phone or switch away from the recipe or video you're looking at

Timelord is great for any hands-on activity when you need to keep track of multiple timers.

It works great with AirPods or with your phone sitting on the counter, and you can listen to music or podcasts while using it.

Timelord is **coming soon** to the iOS App Store. [Join the beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/I6ttbuDu) to use it now.

## Privacy

Timelord never asks for your name, email, or any other information about you. Unless you contact me outside the app, I have no way to contact you and never will.

Timelord doesn't store any information except for the timers you set. Once you remove a timer from the app, it's no longer stored.

Timelord doesn't upload any information to servers. There are no servers.

If you need help or have questions about this policy, email [timelord@tombrow.com](mailto:timelord@tombrow.com).
